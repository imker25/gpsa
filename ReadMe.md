# gpsa - A GPX Statistic extracting tool

This is a simple command line tool that helps to extract data for statistical analysis out of `*.gpx` and `*.tcx` files. You might want to use this program to extract data like `Distance`, `ElevationGain` or `AverageSpeed` from a bunch of `*.gpx` or `*.tcx` files and store this data in a *.csv file for further analysis.

## User Documentation

Some documentation and examples about gpsa usage.

### Installation

Download the latest release executable from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/imker25/gpsa/releases/latest) according to your operation system and copy the file to a empty folder.

**On Linux**, open a command line and set the file executable:

```sh
chmod 770 ./gpsa

# You may want to get the programs help
./gpsa -help
```

**On Windows**, open the command window in this folder and execute the program (may with the -help flag):

```batch
.\gpsa.exe -help
```

### Usage

Below you can find some kind of user manual for this program.

#### Help Command

You might want to call ```-help``` to find out how to use the program.

```txt
~$ ./gpsa -help
./gpsa: Reads in GPS track files, and writes out basic statistic data found in the track as a CSV style report

  files
        One or more track files (only  *.gpx and *.tcx) supported at the moment

#### Output Values explained

Below is a list of the output values and what they mean:

- `Name`: The name of the output line. Either read from the file, or if no name tag is set in the file it will be calculated out of the filename and the file hierarchy.
- `StartTime`: The time the track started. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.
- `EndTime`: The time the track ended. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.
- `TrackTime`: The time between `StartTime` and `EndTime`. Formatted as `xxhxxmxxs`. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.
- `Distance`: The distance of the track measured in `km`.
- `HorizontalDistance`: The horizontal distance of the track measured in `km`. This value ignores the vertical component of the distance like most GPS tools do.
- `AltitudeRange`: The range between the highest and the lowest point. Measured in `m`.
- `MinimumAltitude`: The altitude of the lowest point. Measured in `m`.
- `MaximumAltitude`: The altitude of the highest point. Measured in `m`.
- `ElevationGain`: The total sum of all upwards vertical distance.  Measured in `m`.
- `ElevationLose`: The total sum of all downwards vertical distance.  Measured in `m`.
- `UpwardsDistance`: The total sum of all distance moved upwards.  Measured in `km`.
- `DownwardsDistance`: The total sum of all distance moved downwards.  Measured in `km`.
- `MovingTime`: The time spend moving. Formatted as `xxhxxmxxs`. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.
- `UpwardsTime`: The time spend moving upwards. Formatted as `xxhxxmxxs`. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.
- `DownwardsTime`: The time spend downwards. Formatted as `xxhxxmxxs`. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.
- `AverageSpeed`: The average speed. Calculated from `Distance` and `MovingTime`. Measured in  `km/h`. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.
- `UpwardsSpeed`: The average speed during upwards movement . Measured in  `km/h`. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.
- `DownwardsSpeed`: The average speed during downwards movement . Measured in  `km/h`. *not valid* in case we detect no or invalid time data.

            "args": [
          //      "-dont-panic=false",
                "-out-file=/dev/shm/test.csv",
                "${workspaceRoot}/testdata/valid-gpx/02.gpx"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```json

}
```

## Geo Math Internals

The Geografic calculations are done with the  ```haversine formula```  as described [here](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html). My implementation will ignore altitude differences for distances bigger than 33km by checking the angular distance which in this case then is bigger than 0.3Â°. For smaller distances the program will add the altitude difference using the ```pythagoras theorem```.
